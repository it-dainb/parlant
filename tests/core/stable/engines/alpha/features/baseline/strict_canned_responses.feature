    Scenario: Supplemental canned response is selected based on unfulfilled guideline
        Given an agent whose job is to book taxi rides
        And that the agent uses the canned_strict message composition mode
        And a guideline to tell the customer to wait at curbside when a taxi booking is confirmed
        And a guideline to confirm the taxi booking details from the book_taxi tool when a taxi booking was just confirmed

        And the message at index 2 contains the text "Your driver will meet you at the curbside of your pickup location. Please be ready at the curb when they arrive"
